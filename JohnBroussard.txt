My name is John Broussard and one fun fact about me
is that I graduated Austin Peay State Universiy 
with my associates while in highschool.

The advantage of using git is that when multiple people are working
on a project, git allows you to make branches to a code. This allows 
for individual members to make changes to code without affecting working code.
It makes error detection easier because you can see the branch that went wrong before
the merge. It also allows you to compare team members code.
